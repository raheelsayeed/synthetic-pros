Synthetic PRO FHIR resources generator
=====================================


One of the ways to generate synethic PROs would be to dynamically synthesize FHIR resources from an adaptive service provider.

### Adaptive PROs

1. create a REST client with basic auth

2. create model class to send and receive JSON resources (FHIR resources) 

3. add operation `next-q` operation

4. Add auto-resource generator. Three response categories
    - Mild
    - Moderate
    - Severe
